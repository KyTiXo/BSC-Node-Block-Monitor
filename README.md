# BSC Node Block Monitor
Bash script that compares local geth block number to BSCscan.com's API. If the local node is not a full node yet, it will monitor the log file and display the "Age" from live block from the log every few seconds. This script is useful when trying to monitor or sync a BSC node. Script also has some error handling built into it. See screenshots below.
